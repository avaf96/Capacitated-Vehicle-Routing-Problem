## Problem

Among VRP variants, the CVRP, introduced in Dantzig and Ramser (1959), is the most central and the one from which many others derive. The CVRP plays a particular role in VRP algorithmic research for both exact and heuristic methods. As the most basic variant, it serves as a natural testbed for new ideas.

The input consists of:
- A set of \( n + 1 \) points: a depot and \( n \) customers.
- An \( (n + 1) \times (n + 1) \) distance matrix \( d = [d_{ij}] \) with the distances between every pair of points \( i \) and \( j \).
- An \( n \)-dimensional demand vector \( q = [q_i] \) giving the amount to be delivered to customer \( i \).
- A vehicle capacity \( Q \).

A solution is a set of routes starting and ending at the depot, visiting every customer exactly once, such that the sum of the demands for each route does not exceed the vehicle capacity. The objective is to find a solution with the minimum total route distance. Some authors assume a fixed number of routes as an additional input \( K \); however, we define it as the minimum possible number of routes, \( K_{min} \). Therefore, the \( K_{min} \) indicated in each instance serves only as a lower bound on the number of routes in a solution.

## Learning Objective

You will design various solution methods based on a variety of metaheuristics to tackle the CVRP. Meanwhile, you will become familiar with a range of performance analysis methods. Ultimately, you should recognize the positive and negative aspects of each metaheuristic when applied to solve this problem.

## Instances

CVRP is a well-studied variant with many instances in the literature. Recently, a large and diversified set of benchmark instances was proposed in Uchoa et al. (2017). This set contains 30 instances, with at least 100 to at most 1000 customers. Distances are two-dimensional Euclidean and rounded to the nearest integer, with depot and customers having integer coordinates in a [0, 1000] × [0, 1000] grid. The instance naming format is X-nA-kB, where A represents \( n + 1 \) (the number of points including the depot), and B is the minimum possible number of routes \( K_{min} \).

Instances are generated by systematically varying attributes such as:
- **Depot positioning:** 
  - Central (C) – depot at (500,500)
  - Eccentric (E) – depot at (0,0)
  - Random (R) – depot at a random point in the grid.
- **Customer positioning:** 
  - Random (R) – all customers positioned randomly.
  - Clustered (C) – a number \( S \) of cluster seeds randomly positioned in the grid attracts the remaining customers.
  - Random-clustered (RC) – half clustered as above, the rest positioned randomly.
- **Demand distribution:** Seven possibilities.
- **Average route size:** Five distinct ranges equal to \( n/K_{min} \). 

It is essential to have instances with varying attributes to check the performance of an algorithm in constructing solutions with long or short paths.

Routes should be sequentially numbered, with no empty routes allowed. Report the best, average, and worst solutions found during three runs for each instance, and average computation time over these runs. Another experiment should involve running the algorithm for five minutes on each instance.
